                <!--<p>To start the game, each player draws ten white cards.</p>
                <p>
                    According to the rule book provided with the game, the person who most recently
                    defecated (a form of primitive randomization) begins as the "Card Czar" (or "Card
                    Tsar") and plays a black card, face up. The Card Czar then reads the question or
                    fill-in-the-blanks phrase on the black card out loud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other players answer the question or fill in the blanks by each passing one white
                    card (or however many required by the black card), face down, to the Card Czar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Card Czar shuffles all of the answers and shares each card combination with the
                    group. For full effect, the Card Czar should usually re-read the black card before
                    presenting each answer. The Card Czar then picks the funniest play, and whoever
                    submitted it gets one "Awesome Point".
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar, and everyone draws back up to 10
                    white cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The part of speech of a white card is a noun or gerund, including both single words
                    and phrase constructions. Black cards are either fill-in-the-blank statements or
                    questions. Both white and black cards break these rules on rare occasions.
                </p>
                <p>The rules do not state how to win the gameâ€”the object being simply to have fun.</p>
                <p>
                    The rules in Cards Against Humanity are flexible and can be altered with the many
                    house rules (which are listed in the rules) that players can incorporate (e.g.
                    winning cards are chosen democratically, ability to trade points for cards, points
                    given by ranks, etc.). The official rules include additional provisions for gambling
                    previously won "Awesome Points" for the right to play additional white cards during a
                    round.
